# 📖 Legal Case managment System   <a name="about-project"></a>

**[tms ]**  This system is developed to help law firms and legal departments of Ethiopian airlines to manage their cases more efficiently. It is a powerful tool that can streamline the legal process, increase productivity, and improve communication between team members. One of the key features of this system is its ability to store and organize all case-related information in one central location. This includes documents, emails, notes, and other relevant files. This allows for easy access and retrieval of information, which can save time and reduce the risk of errors.
